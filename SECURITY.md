# Security Policy

## Supported versions

rustydocs is pre-1.0 and ships fixes only against the latest release. Security
fixes land on `main` and go out in the next version.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest release (`0.2.x`) | ✅ |
| older releases | ❌ |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** — do not open a public issue for a
suspected vulnerability.

Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability):
go to the repository's **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**. This opens
a private advisory visible only to the maintainers.

When reporting, please include:

- the version (`rustydocs --version`) and platform,
- a description of the issue and its impact,
- a minimal repository or input that reproduces it, if applicable,
- any suggested remediation.

You can expect an initial acknowledgement within a few days. Because rustydocs is
a small, single-maintainer project, please allow reasonable time for a fix before
any public disclosure.

## Scope notes

rustydocs reads files from a content tree, invokes `git` (`blame`, `log`) on the
repository, and writes Markdown/HTML/JSON reports. The most relevant classes of
issue are input-handling problems triggered by a malicious or malformed
repository — for example: excessive resource use on crafted files, panics,
path traversal in resolved includes or output paths, or HTML report output that
injects markup from untrusted document content. Reports that demonstrate such
behavior from a crafted input are in scope.
